Hello! Glad you opened this.
contents.txt is storing all the files that are hidden with no security,
but the way it's hidden is pretty unknown to most people, so nobody will find the files.
It is still secure, since you can't have alternate data streams in an USB drive because it stores files differently.
Your files are safe, unless you have AlternateDataStreamView or something like that on your PC.
You can't change the names of the folders, that will make them inaccessible.
Ironically, you can change the content of contents.txt, but not its name.
You can delete this README file now.
